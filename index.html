    <h1>Welcome to the landing page for Sulfonylinime Reactions!</h1>
    <p>There are two reaction mechanisms shown by this website, one for a <a href="cyclic.html">cyclic sulfonylimine</a>
        and one for an <a href="acyclic.html">acyclic sulfonylimine</a>. Please click the respective links to view the
        mechanisms.</p>
    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <p>The two pages mentioned above make use of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/">JSmol Molecular
            Viewer</a> to render each step of the mechanism. This viewer makes use of either HTML5 or WebGL to render
        the molecules. Both technologies require the use of a relatively new web browser (Chromium or Firefox) to work
        properly. Additionally, since each pages has a total of 12 molecules to render, the loading time of the webpages
        is fairly long, and it may appear that the website is frozen. To show that it is not frozen, a sample rendering
        of benzene is included and is loaded last. Once this molecule is rendered, the entire site is ready to be
        viewed. Neither page has been tested on a mobile device and a desktop or laptop computer is recommended.</p>
    <h2>Website features</h2>
    <p>By default, all molecules are rendered with HTML5 as this is the only way the molecular vibrations can be shown
        using JSmol. However, WebGL versions of the <a href="cyclic.html?USE=WEBGL">cyclic sulfonylimine reaction</a> 
        and the <a href="acyclic.html?USE=WEBGL">acyclic sulfonylimine reaction</a> are available using the respective
        hyperlinks. By default, vibrations are shown only for the negative frequency associated with each transition
        state, but the frequencies for other steps can be activated by right-clicking the molecule, changing the model
        to the desired vibration, and then turning vibrations on through the JSmol menu. Finally, fullscreen renderings
        of each step are available and are linked on each webpage.</p>
    <h2>Other ways to view the content</h2>
    <p>Given the heavy resources needed by each page, you may wish to download the 3D coordinates, frequencies, and
        Molecular orbitals yourself. To do so, links are provided to the <a href="http://gaussian.com">Gaussian16</a>
        output log and checkpoint file for each step of the reaction. These files can also be obtained from the
        <a href="http://github.com/chopralab/sulfonylimine_reactivity">repository.</a></p>
